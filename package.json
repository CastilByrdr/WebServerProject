Iâ€™ve created a few frontend only webpages either as tests or for portfolio purposes, as well as creating some programs where I created a relatively simple game and another where I connected to an Arduino board to create a specific machine. I also helped create a more detailed full stack webpage on a sort of e-commerce site for an online game. \r ---\r > Although I have done a bit of full stack work before I believe this class will greatly expand my knowledge of it, as currently it is relatively rudimentary. I hope to use this knowledge to be able to create detailed webpages on any topic I would need to create a webpage for, whether it be a frontend only site meant to advertise a product/business or a more extensive site that would require a database to keep track of users/products. I hope to be able to satisfy a wide range of requests and be able to be a member of a programming team that can be relied on to handle various aspects of development.",
